## Advent of Code 2021 noodling

I've set an arbtirary constraint of only using builtins.  No stdlib, no numpy, no pypi.  So each solution should have no import statements at all.  We'll see how far I get.  Definitely missing itertools and friends at day 11, but it's forcing me to get good at some basics again.
